# TypeText-Generator
A dialogue generator for Project Arrhythmia. Alpha oriented, Legacy supported. (Hopefully)

**You don't have to download this script to use it, you can just click on `typetext_generator.js` and copy the code to your clipboard.**

Using the script is hilariously simple. Take the script, run it in a JS console, for instance your browser console. 
Some people are weary (rightfully so) of pasting someone else's code into the dev console, so you can execute it in a JS interpreter website like https://jsconsole.com/
Once it's run, use the command `generatePrefab(params)` to start it.

Once run, it'll spit out a massive glob of text. All you have to do is copy that text and paste it into a text file for Project Arrhythmia to use.
The path for prefab files is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Project Arrhythmia\\beatmaps\\prefabs
If you're using Legacy, make sure the file extension is .lsp
If you're using Alpha, make sure the file extension is .vgp

Once the prefab is created, save and reload to update the prefabs list. Good to go!
